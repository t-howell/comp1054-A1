			<p id="mainParagraph">In 1993, some guy finished a font that was inspired by Roman Somethings. He had been
			interested in this style, and could not understand why it had not been implemented
			with modern font-faces. So he created a font with these things, and called it Georgia. 
			This font was built for Microsoft for web use. It is optimal for screen viewing because
			of its boldness and double-wide pixels where most fonts of its type only used single pixels
			(like on the skinny bits). It also features taller lower case letters, making it more legible
			at different sizes. The font was released in 1996, and we all lived happily ever after.

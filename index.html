			<p id="mainParagraph">In 1993, Matthew Carter finished a font that was inspired by Scotch Romans. He had been
			interested in this style, and could not understand why it had not been implemented
			with modern font-faces. So he created a font with these Scotch Romans, and called it <em>Georgia</em>. 
			This font was built for Microsoft for web use. It is optimal for screen viewing because
			of its boldness and double-wide pixels where most fonts of it's type only used single pixels
			(like on the thin lines and serifs). It also features taller lower case letters, making it more legible
			at different sizes. The font was released in 1996.
